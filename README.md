# **Roger skyline (part I)**

42 (Paris)

### **Description**

This is just a prototype to quickly test the assignments of the `roger-skyline-1` project
using `docker` and `docker-compose`.

### **Usage**

Executing the `run.sh` script docker will: 

+ build the image from the `Dockerfile` 
+ create the bridge network from the `network.sh` script
+ deploy the `react` version of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) with `docker-compose`

Happy hacking!
